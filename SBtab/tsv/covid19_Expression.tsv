SIGMA	sigma	4	this can be another value as well, but not too big not too small
MU	mu	-g	the mode parameter g is subject to sampling (~optimization)
X1	DIFF	(t-mu)/sigma	convenience expression
X2	DIFFSQ	DIFF*DIFF	convenience expression
X3	EDIFFSQ	exp(-0.5*DIFFSQ)	convenience expression
X4	NORM	sqrt(2*Pi)*sigma	normalisation to 1.0
N	Gaussian	EDIFFSQ/NORM	probability density of first infection
