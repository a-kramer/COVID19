SIGMA	sigma	4	this can be another value as well, but not too big not too small
MU	mu	-g	the mode parameter g is subject to sampling (~optimization)
X1	DIFF	(t-mu)/sigma	convenience expression
X2	DIFFSQ	DIFF*DIFF	convenience expression
X3	EDIFFSQ	exp(-0.5*DIFFSQ)	convenience expression
X4	NORM	sqrt(2*Pi)*sigma	normalisation to 1.0
N	Gaussian	EDIFFSQ/NORM	probability density of first infection
	b	r0*l	becoming exposed/duration of sickness
	b_dist	r0_dist*l	same, but after social distancing in effect
Distancing_Switch	B	(b*(1-distancing_on) + b_dist*distancing_on) 	b when distancing is off (0) or b_dist when distancing is on (1)
